Understanding the Basics of Defining Functions:


def() is a very common method to 'contain' functions in python.
By using def() in Python, you can organize your code into reusable blocks, make your code readable, and reduce the chances of bugs. These activities will give you a good understanding of the basics of defining functions in Python, and you can continue to build on these concepts as you become more comfortable with Python

Let's look at the process of using one with a simple example for you to try

    1. Create a simple function to find the sum of two numbers.
    2. Define the function using def keyword, followed by the function name and  brackets.
    3. Write the logic inside the function to find the sum of the two numbers and return the result.
    4. Call the function with different input values to check if it's working as expected.
